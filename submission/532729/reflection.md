# Personal Reflection

Overall, I believe that the goal of this project, which is to design, deploy, and verify a smart contract for proof of existence on the Sepolia testnet, has been successfully achieved. This can be seen from the fact that my contract was deployed, verified on Etherscan, and interacted with correctly, producing both true and false verification results at their respective hashes. Furthermore, the project required not only deploying the contract but also handling Sepolia ETH for transactions and gas fees, which deepened my understanding of blockchain networks. Another important aspect that I completed was verifying and publishing the contract on Etherscan, making it transparent and accessible similar to real world contracts. 

Looking back at the code, I learned the value of using mapping(bytes32 => uint256) public proofs; to securely store document hashes with timestamps. The require statement in notarizeDocument also stood out, as it prevented duplicate entries and ensured data integrity. Still, the contract could be improved with better access control or more efficient timestamp handling. By combining notarizeDocument and verifyDocument, I was able to achieve reliable verification of document existence on the blockchain.
